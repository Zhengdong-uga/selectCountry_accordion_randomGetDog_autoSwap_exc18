// Remember to import stuff, and if you forget, make sure your
// editor didn't 'help' by adding something you didn't want.

// Add a button that is replaced with a progress meter while the operation is in progress
// You'll be using the LoadingButton
// Use https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/

// At the time this was created, LoadingButton is not yet part of MUI core,
// so it will likely require installing the MUI lab components.
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/lab

// When you click the button, get a dog image from 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random'
// and post it below the '<Box>' set the image width to 200.

// You can start with this as your return:
//  return (
//     <>
//       <Box sx={{ my: 2 }}>
//       {/* loading button */}
//       </Box>
//       {/* Dog Image */}
//     </>)
